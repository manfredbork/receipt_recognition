# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.2] – 2025-11-19

### 🛠️ Changed
- **Product recognition threshold**: Increased strictness for position confirmation – now requires **80% of positions** to pass validation (up from 75%) for more reliable receipt parsing.
- **Product name handling**: Improved handling of leading digits – now allows product names with leading digits if they contain **6 or more letters total**, reducing false rejections.

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Normalization**: Removed verbose debug comments from OCR correction logic, improving code clarity.
- **Integration tests**: Corrected asset path reference in integration tests.

### 🧹 Housekeeping
- Removed `.metadata` tracking file from version control in example app.
- Updated `.gitignore` to exclude metadata files going forward.

---

## [0.2.1] – 2025-11-13

### ✨ Added
- Added **Spar** to the default store list.

### 🛠️ Changed
- Store and total-label detection is now **more tolerant** to OCR spacing glitches.
- Store extraction now only considers candidates **above the first amount line**, reducing false positives.
- Improved **skew angle estimation** for more stable item alignment.
- Parser now performs a fallback pass to assign **unmatched amounts**, reducing missing line items.

### 🐛 Fixed
- **Purchase date** handling no longer locks onto early, unstable detections; continuous scans refine it correctly.
- Minor stability improvements in the optimizer and parser.

---

## [0.2.0] – 2025-11-08

### ✨ Added

- **Unit price & quantity parsing**: extract quantity and price-per-unit for line items.
- **`allowedProductGroups`** option to control which product groups are accepted during parsing.
- **Position bounding box** exposure for recognized positions.
- Minor improvements around pseudo positions for better preview/UX.

### 🛠️ Changed

- Tuned defaults for stability and performance (cache size, thresholds, timeouts).
- Normalization tweaks: treat `+` as a normal character; refined space handling; extended patterns.
- Removed legacy keyword groups (discount/deposit) in favor of `allowedProductGroups`.
- Internal type/use cleanups (prefer `double`/`int` where appropriate).
- Purchase date recognition is tuned for better robustness.

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Lost groups during merging**: fixed issues where groups could disappear or be dropped in long/unstable scans.
- **Deposit handling**: corrected parsing so deposit lines don’t corrupt totals or item classification.
- **Product group classification**: fixes to ensure correct group assignment and consistent downstream behavior.
- General stability fixes across optimizer and parser components.

---

## [0.1.9] – 2025-10-27

### ✨ Added

- Unit tests covering additional normalization scenarios.

### 🛠️ Changed

- Adjusted `onScanTimeout` signature in `ReceiptRecognizer`.
- Improved normalization and output: use normalized text consistently and refined purchase date output.
- Tuned optimizer cache for better stability and responsiveness.

### 🐛 Fixed

- Corrected skew angle handling and bounds calculation for accurate receipt alignment.
- Prevented misclassification of prices as product names.

## [0.1.8] - 2024-10-25

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Pass static analysis**: Reformatted `receipt_recognition-dart` to reach 50/50 points

---

## [0.1.7] – 2025-10-24

### ✨ Added

- Integration test for single-image recognition in the example app:
    - `example/integration_test/receipt_recognizer_test.dart`
- `purchaseDate` detection and exposure on `RecognizedReceipt`.
- Configurability via the new options/tuning system:
    - `ReceiptOptions` to control parsing, validation, and scanning behavior.
    - `ReceiptTuning` for adjustable merge/stability thresholds.
    - `kReceiptDefaultOptions` as a sensible baseline.
    - `ReceiptRuntime` helper to apply options during parsing.

### 🛠️ Changed

- `processImage` now always returns a `RecognizedReceipt` (never `null`), even when incomplete or invalid.
- Clarified result semantics for continuous scanning (video):
    - `isValid`: essential structure present and totals are coherent.
    - `isConfirmed`: result stabilized across frames (finalized by optimizer).
- Scanning guidance:
    - Video: stop when `receipt.isValid && receipt.isConfirmed`.
    - Single image: `isConfirmed` typically not achievable; treat `isValid` as sufficient or prompt re-capture.
- Parser and Optimizer refactored and improved for more robust extraction and more stable results across frames.

### 🧹 Deprecated

- `minValidScans` in `ReceiptRecognizer` (constructor parameter) in favor of stability/confirmation rules and tuning via
  `ReceiptOptions`/`ReceiptTuning`.
- Legacy `sum`/`sumLabel` naming: prefer `total` (`RecognizedTotal`) and `totalLabel` (`RecognizedTotalLabel`).
- `RecognizedCompany` is considered legacy; prefer `RecognizedStore`.
