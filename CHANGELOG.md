## [0.2.8] – 2026-01-08

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Unit Parsing**: Improved logic for separating unit prices from product text, specifically handling cases where unit
  information might appear as trailing text or between other tokens more reliably.

---

## [0.2.7] – 2025-12-28

### 🛠️ Changed

- **Bounding Box Stability**: Added a default zero-degree angle to bounding boxes generated from multi-line entities,
  ensuring more consistent geometry during receipt reconstruction.

### ✅ Tests

  quantities and unit prices for line items.

---

## [0.2.6] – 2025-12-27

### ✨ Added

- **Aldi-style unit support**: Added logic to detect and parse unit information (quantity/price) when printed on the
  line **above** the product name (common on Aldi receipts).
- **Expanded Currency Support**: Improved monetary regex to handle currency symbols appearing after the amount (e.g.,
  `0,49 €`).

### 🛠️ Changed

- **Skew Angle Optimization**: Implemented a more robust, weighted-median approach for skew estimation across multiple
  frames, significantly improving alignment stability during video scans.

  better distinguish between item amounts and unknown metadata.
- **Unit Detection**: Enhanced `_tryParseUnit` and `_tryParseUnknown` to use more precise horizontal center-bounds,
  preventing misclassification of product text as unknown entities.
- **Integer Parsing**: Improved integer extraction logic to ensure quantity detection doesn't accidentally pick up parts
  of decimal numbers.

### ✅ Tests

- **ALDI Integration**: Added comprehensive integration tests for ALDI receipts, validating store name, total, purchase
  date, and multi-line unit/quantity parsing.

---

## [0.2.5] – 2025-12-14

### ✨ Added

  `RecognizedUnknown`)
- **Unit boundary detection**: Changed unit parsing to use `_rightL(line)` instead of `_leftL(line)` for proper
  right-bound checking

  proper sign adjustment.
- **Unit validation**: Corrected unit price-quantity validation logic to properly check tolerance thresholds.
- **Parsing stability**: Multiple fixes to improve parsing reliability and reduce edge-case errors.

---

## [0.1.7] – 2025-10-24

### ✨ Added

- Integration test for single-image recognition in the example app:
    - `example/integration_test/receipt_recognizer_test.dart`
- `purchaseDate` detection and exposure on `RecognizedReceipt`.
- Configurability via the new options/tuning system:
    - `ReceiptOptions` to control parsing, validation, and scanning behavior.
    - `ReceiptTuning` for adjustable merge/stability thresholds.
    - `kReceiptDefaultOptions` as a sensible baseline.
    - `ReceiptRuntime` helper to apply options during parsing.

### 🛠️ Changed

- `processImage` now always returns a `RecognizedReceipt` (never `null`), even when incomplete or invalid.
- Clarified result semantics for continuous scanning (video):
    - `isValid`: essential structure present and totals are coherent.
    - `isConfirmed`: result stabilized across frames (finalized by optimizer).
- Scanning guidance:
    - Video: stop when `receipt.isValid && receipt.isConfirmed`.
    - Single image: `isConfirmed` typically not achievable; treat `isValid` as sufficient or prompt re-capture.
- Parser and Optimizer refactored and improved for more robust extraction and more stable results across frames.

### 🧹 Deprecated

- `minValidScans` in `ReceiptRecognizer` (constructor parameter) in favor of stability/confirmation rules and tuning via
  `ReceiptOptions`/`ReceiptTuning`.
- Legacy `sum`/`sumLabel` naming: prefer `total` (`RecognizedTotal`) and `totalLabel` (`RecognizedTotalLabel`).
- `RecognizedCompany` is considered legacy; prefer `RecognizedStore`.
